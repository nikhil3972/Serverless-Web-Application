## Introduction

Serverless computing allows us to build and run
applications and services without thinking about servers.
With serverless computing, your application still runs on
servers, but all the server management is done by AWS.
Using AWS and its Serverless Platform, we can build and
deploy applications on cost-effective services that provide
built-in application availability and flexible scaling
capabilities. This lets us focus on your application code
instead of worrying about provisioning, configuring, and
managing servers.
